This repository demonstrates a common COBOL error: numeric overflow.  The `bug.cob` file contains code that attempts to store a value larger than the variable's defined capacity, leading to an overflow. The `bugSolution.cob` file shows the corrected code with appropriate data types to prevent the error.  The solution includes using a larger PIC clause to accommodate the expected range of values.
